# Dynamic-Clustering-in-Federated-Learning
This work introduces a dynamic GAN-based clustering algorithm for Federated Learning to enhance time series forecasting accuracy in wireless network resource management. Addressing the limitations of traditional clustering algorithms with non-IID data, it shows a 43% improvement in cellular handover forecasting. The three-phased approach—GAN-based clustering, cluster calibration, and cluster division—preserves privacy, creates dynamic clusters, and adapts cluster numbers over time. Extensive simulations validate its efficacy across various scenarios, including power demand, pen digit tracing, and pedestrian count. Despite longer execution times and potential single-client clusters, it offers a promising solution for efficient resource management.
